Minneapolis-centered community engagement app for a bike advocacy group or city planning department. Built with Angular and Leaflet, using the CARTO SQL API for data storage.

Inspired by http://maps.graphicarto.com/twincityhoods/ (Mike Foster) and with many hat tips to https://github.com/radumas/crowdmap-basic. 

_Still a work in progress._
